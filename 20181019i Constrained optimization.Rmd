### The Lagrange multiplier

Suppose f(x,y) is to be optimized subject to a constraint g(x,y) == 0  
Then we we have to find the critical points in  
L (x,y,lambda) == f(x,y) - lambda*g(x,y)  
L is known as the Lagrangean; lambda is known as the Lagrange multiplier

### Example

```{r,message=FALSE}
library(Ryacas)
library(mosaic)
library(manipulate)
```

f(x) == x^2 + y^2; subject to the constraint x + y == 1;  
i.e. L == x^2 + y^2 - lambda*(x+y-1)  

```{r}
x = Sym('x')
y = Sym('y')
lambda = Sym('lambda')
L = x^2 + y^2 - lambda*(x+y-1)
dLx = deriv(L,x); dLx
dLy = deriv(L,y); dLy
dLlambda = deriv(L,lambda); dLlambda
```

```{r}
Solve(List(dLx==0,dLy==0,dLlambda==0),List(x,y,lambda))
```
