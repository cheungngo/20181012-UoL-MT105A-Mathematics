### Vectors

```{r}
x = c(1,2,3); x
```

### Transpose of vectors

```{r}
t(x)
```

### Multiplying by a number

```{r}
7*x
```

### Sum of vectors

```{r}
x = c(1,2,3)
y = c(3,2,1)
x + y
```

### Inner product (dot) of vectors

```{r}
sum(x*y)
```

### length of a vector

```{r}
sqrt(sum(x*x))
```

### 0 vector and 1 vector

```{r}
rep(0,5)
rep(1,5)
```

### Orthogonal vector

Defined by v1 dot v2 = 0
```{r}
v1 = c(-1,1); v2 = c(1,1)
sum(v1*v2)
```
