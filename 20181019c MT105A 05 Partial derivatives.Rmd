### First and second order partial derivatives

Actually very simple  
Just treat the other var as constant  

```{r,message=FALSE}
library(Ryacas)
library(mosaic)
```

#### Let Z = x^2 * y + y^3 * x

```{r}
y = Sym('y')
x = Sym('x')
Z = x^2 * y + y^3 * x
Zx = deriv(Z,x); Zx
Zy = deriv(Z,y); Zy
Zxx = deriv(Zx,x); Zxx
Zxy = deriv(Zx,y); Zxy
Zyx = deriv(Zy,x); Zyx
Zyy = deriv(Zy,y); Zyy
```

### Graphing functions of two variables

```{r}
library(manipulate)
# Required for plotting surface = T
```

```{r}
plotFun(x^2 * y + y^3 * x ~ x & y, surface = T)
```
