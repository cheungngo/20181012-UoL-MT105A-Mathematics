```{r,message=FALSE}
library(mosaic)
library(Ryacas)
```

### makeFun()

Let f = x+3

```{r}
f = makeFun(x+3~x)
f
```

### Composite functions in mosaic

Suppose f(x) = x+1, g(x) = x^4;  
Now to find the composite function g(f(x))

```{r}
f = makeFun(x+1~x)
g = makeFun(x^4~x)
x = Sym('x')
g(x=x+1) # g(f(x))
f(x=x^4) # f(g(x))
```

And this would be easier than just using Ryacas

### plotFun()

Let f = x+3 again

```{r}
f = makeFun(x+3~x)
plotFun(f(x)~x, x.lim=c(-5,5))
```

### what about a composition function

```{r}
g = makeFun(x^4~x)
h = g(x=x+1) # f(x) = x+1
h # expression((x + 1)^4)
# You may just need to copy and paste the expression (otherwise quite clumpsy)
h = makeFun((x + 1)^4~x)
plotFun(h(x)~x,x.lim=c(-100,100))
```
