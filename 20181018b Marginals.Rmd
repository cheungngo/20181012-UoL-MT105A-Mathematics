### Principles

Let total cost to be TC(q)    
For a small change in q, we need to find the increase or decrease in cost, i.e. marginal costs  
TC'(q) = delta TC / delta q  
then the marginal costs, i.e. delta TC = TC'(q) * delta q  
When delta q was not given, and q is large, 1 unit would be comparable to delta q  
In this way, delta TC = TC'(q)  

### Worked example

```{r,message=FALSE}
library(Ryacas)
library(mosaic)
```

Let TC(q) == 50000 + 25*q + 0.001*q^2  
What would be the marginal cost if q = 100 and q = 10000

```{r}
q = Sym('q')
f = 50000 + 25*q + 0.001*q^2
df = deriv(f,q)
df
```

```{r}
# marginal cost
Eval(df,list(q=c(100,10000)))
```
