### the chain rule

There are three functions: f(x,y); x(t); y(t)  
And we would like to find the derivatives of f(x,y) against t  
The first method we will be going for would be expressing f(x,y) in terms of t  
Which would cause alot of manipulations  

The chain rule simplify these calculations:  
##### d/dt f(x,y) = df(x,y)/dx * dx/dt + df(x,y)/dy * dy/dt

```{r,message=FALSE}
library(Ryacas)
library(mosaic)
```

f(x,y) = x^2*y  
x(t) = 3+2*t  
y(t) = 10-0.2*t  

```{r}
x = Sym('x'); y = Sym('y'); t = Sym('t')
f = x^2*y 
xt = 3+2*t
yt = 10-0.2*t
```

```{r}
# LHS
fx = makeFun(x^2*y ~ x & y)
fx_t = fx(x=xt,y=yt)
LHS = deriv(fx_t,t)
Simplify(LHS)
```

```{r}
# RHS
dfdx = deriv(f,x)
dfdy = deriv(f,y)
dxdt = deriv(xt,t)
dydt = deriv(yt,t)
RHS = dfdx*dxdt + dfdy*dydt
RHS
RHS_t = makeFun(4 * (x * y) - 0.2 * x^2 ~ x & y)
RHS = RHS_t(x=xt,y=yt)
Simplify(RHS)
```
