### Summation in R

Suppose that x1 = 1; x2 = 3; x3 = -1; x4 = 5

Calculate the summation of x^2 from i=1 to i=4

```{r}
i = c(1,3,-1,5)
x = Sym('x')
x2 = Eval(x^2,list(x=i[1:4]))
print(x2)
sum(x2)
```

###

### Products in R

Now x1 = 2, x2 = 9, x3 = 5, x4 = 3

Calculate the products of x^2 + x - 1 from i=1 to i=4

```{r}
i = c(2,9,5,3)
x = Sym('x')
f = x^2 + x - 1
fx = Eval(f, list(x=i[1:4]))
print(fx)
prod(fx)
```
